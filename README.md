# Fokus

**Fokus** is an application inspired by the Pomodoro technique, designed to improve time management for specific activities. It offers three timing modes: Focus (25 minutes), Short Break (5 minutes), and Long Break (15 minutes), each adjustable to suit your needs. Additionally, it includes an option to activate ambient music and adapts the visual interface based on the active mode, providing distinctive text and colors for a more focused and productive experience. Fokus is aimed at anyone looking to optimize their productivity and concentration during work or study periods, making it useful for students, professionals, and anyone interested in better managing their time and maintaining efficient work sessions.
